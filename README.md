### Athletic_sales_analysis

#### Project Description

In this project, I analyzed data to gain insights over the cities that sold the most athletic wear over the years 2020 and 2021.
I was able to read into a csv file to extract the data and display it as a Data Frame. This enabled me to easily determine crucial statistics such as the sales of different retailers, the sales of specific athletic wears and even the days and weeks when the sales were highest and lowest.

The ability to analyse and manipulate data in this way is very helpful in getting detailed and specific information about the trend of shopping in the public domain which can be very valuable information for companies.
